## Introduction

We propose a novel intensity diffraction tomography (IDT) reconstruction algorithm based on the split-step non-paraxial (SSNP) model for recovering the 3D refractive index (RI) distribution of multiple-scattering biological samples.
High-quality IDT reconstruction requires high-angle illumination to encode both low- and high- spatial frequency information of the 3D biological sample.
Our SSNP model can more accurately compute multiple scattering from high-angle illumination compared to paraxial approximation-based multiple-scattering models.
We apply this SSNP model to both sequential and multiplexed IDT techniques. 
We develop a unified reconstruction algorithm for both IDT modalities that is highly computationally efficient and is implemented by a modular automatic differentiation framework.
We demonstrate the capability of our reconstruction algorithm on both weakly scattering buccal epithelial cells and strongly scattering live *C. elegans* worms and live *C. elegans* embryos.

## Installation

1. Prepare the environment for PyCUDA library (the [PyCUDA wiki page](https://wiki.tiker.net/PyCuda/Installation/) was not updated for a long time and hard to follow)
   1. Install a C/C++ compiler, and add it to your PATH (`gcc` for Linux and `cl.exe` for Windows)
   2. Install the CUDA library. If you prefer conda as virtual environment manager, you can install the [`nvidia::cuda`](https://anaconda.org/nvidia/cuda) package:
   ```shell
   conda install nvidia::cuda
   ```
   Note: `scikit-cuda` cannot find some CUDA versions automatically on Windows. It's possible to change the related code in `scikit-cuda` rather than reinstall an old version of CUDA, but do it at your own risk.
2. Install the `ssnp` package in this repository
   ```shell
   pip install "git+https://github.com/bu-cisl/SSNP-IDT#subdirectory=ssnp_pkg"
   ```
3. Download the examples and run with Python
